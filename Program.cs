// A tour of the C# language

// C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
// C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language.
// At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.

// Several C# features help create robust and durable applications:
//      1 - Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.
//      2 - Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.
//      3 - Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.
//      4 - Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.
//      5 - Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.
//      6 - Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.
//      7 - C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.
//          All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner.
//          C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.
//      8 - C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.
//      9 - C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.
//      10- C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.
//      11- C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.
//          Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers,
//          the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.
