﻿// A tour of the C# language

/*
 * C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
 * C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language.
 * At its core, C# is an object-oriented language. You define types and their behavior.
 */

/* Several C# features help create robust and durable applications:
 * 1 - Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory occupied by unreachable unused objects.
 * 2 - Nullable types guard against variables that don't refer to allocated objects.
 * 3 - Exception handling provides a structured and extensible approach to error detection and recovery.
 * 4 - Lambda expressions support functional programming techniques.
 * 5 - Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax creates a common pattern for working with data from any source.
 * 6 - Language support for asynchronous operations provides syntax for building distributed systems.
 * 7 - C# has a unified type system. All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root object type.
 *     All types share a set of common operations. Values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner.
 *     C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types.
 * 8 - C# allows dynamic allocation of objects and in-line storage of lightweight structures.
 * 9 - C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance.
 * 10- C# provides iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom behaviors for client code.
 * 11- C# emphasizes versioning to ensure programs and libraries can evolve over time in a compatible manner.
 *     Aspects of C#'s design that were directly influenced by versioning considerations include the separate virtual and override modifiers,
 *     the rules for method overload resolution, and support for explicit interface member declarations.

// .NET Architecture

/*
 * C# programs run on .NET:  a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries.
 * The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard.
 * The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.
 */

/*
 * Source code written in C# is compiled into an intermediate language (IL) that conforms to the CLI specification.
 * The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of .dll.
 * An assembly contains a manifest that provides information about the assembly's types, version, and culture.
 */

/*
 * When the C# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR.
 * The CLR performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions.
 * The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management.
 * Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code".
 * "Unmanaged code" is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.
 */

/*
 * Language interoperability is a key feature of .NET.
 * IL code produced by the C# compiler conforms to the Common Type Specification (CTS).
 * IL code generated from C# can interact with code that was generated from the .NET versions of F#, Visual Basic, C++.
 * There are more than 20 other CTS-compliant languages.
 * A single assembly may contain multiple modules written in different .NET languages.
 * The types can reference each other as if they were written in the same language.
 */

/*
 * In addition to the run time services, .NET also includes extensive libraries.
 * These libraries support many different workloads.
 * They're organized into namespaces that provide a wide variety of useful functionality.
 * The libraries include everything from file input and output to string manipulation to XML parsing, to web application frameworks to Windows Forms controls.
 * The typical C# application uses the .NET class library extensively to handle common "plumbing" chores.

// Hello world

// The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:

using System;

class Hello
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}

/*
 * The "Hello, World" program starts with a using directive that references the System namespace.
 * Namespaces provide a hierarchical means of organizing C# programs and libraries.
 * Namespaces contain types and other namespaces.
 * for example, the System namespace contains a number of types, such as the Console class referenced in the program, and a number of other namespaces, such as IO and Collections.
 * A using directive that references a given namespace enables unqualified use of the types that are members of that namespace.
 * Because of the using directive, the program can use Console.WriteLine as shorthand for System.Console.WriteLine.
 * */

/*
 * The Hello class declared by the "Hello, World" program has a single member, the method named Main.
 * The Main method is declared with the static modifier.
 * While instance methods can reference a particular enclosing object instance using the keyword this, static methods operate without reference to a particular object.
 * By convention, a static method named Main serves as the entry point of a C# program.
 */

/*
 * The output of the program is produced by the WriteLine method of the Console class in the System namespace.
 * This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced by the compiler.
